/*
 * Suppose we number the bytes in a w-bit word from 0 (least significant) to w/8 âˆ’ 1 (most significant). Write code for the following C function, which will return an unsigned value in which byte i of argument x has been replaced by byte b:
 *  unsigned replace_byte (unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b);
 *  Here are some examples showing how the function should work:
 *  replace_byte(0x12345678, 2, 0xAB) --> 0x12AB5678
 *  replace_byte(0x12345678, 0, 0xAB) --> 0x123456AB
